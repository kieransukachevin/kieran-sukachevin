        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Kieran Sukachevin. I am a software developer and artist 
            looking to combine my skills and interests in programming and art.
            In the Spring of 2022, I graduated from Walla Walla University with a major in computer science and a minor in art.
            I am currently searching for a career in software development, focusing in the area of user interface engineering.
            Check out my website which includes my software projects and art!
